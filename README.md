# SafeHarbor  
A Maritime Alert App for Coastal Fishermen

SafeHarbor is a lightweight mobile application designed to protect small-scale fishermen from unintentionally crossing maritime borders. With offline functionality and real-time vibration alerts, the app acts as a silent guardian at sea.

## Problem

Small-scale fishermen often lack awareness of maritime boundaries, especially when venturing far offshore without proper navigation tools. Accidental border crossing has led to detainment, fines, and long-term distress for many.
